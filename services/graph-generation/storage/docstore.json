ESS3 recognizes that economic activity \nand urbanization often generate pollution to air, water, and land, and consume finite resources that may threaten people, eco-system services and the environment at the local, regional, and gl obal lev els. The cur-\nrent and projected atmospheric concentra-tion of greenhouse gases (GHG) threatens the welfare of current and future genera-tions. At the same time, more efficient and effective r esource  use, pollution preven-\ntion and GHG emission avoidance, and mitigation technologies and practices have become more accessible and achievable.2. This ESS sets out the requirements to address \nresource efficiency and pollution1 prevention and \nmanagement2 throughout the project life cycle \nconsistent with GIIP.\nObjectives\n\u03d8To promote the sustainable use of resources, including energy, water and raw materials.\n\u03d8To avoid or minimize adverse impacts on human health and the environment by avoiding or mini-mizing pollution from project activities.\n\u03d8To avoid or minimize project-related emissions of short and long-lived climate pollutants.\n3\n\u03d8To avoid or minimize generation of hazardous and non-hazardous waste.\n\u03d8To minimize and manage the risks and impacts associated with pesticide use.\nScope of application\n3.

The efficient use of energy is an important way \nin which the Bor rower can contribute to sustain-\nable devel opment.

To address potential adverse project impacts \non human health and the environment,8 the Bor-\nrower will consider relevant factors, including, for example: (a) existing ambient conditions; (b) in areas already impacted by pollution, the remaining assimilative capacity\n9 of the environment; (c) \u041dexist-\ning and future land use; (d) the project\u2019s proximity to areas of importance to biodiversity; (e) the potential for cumulative impacts with uncertain and/or irre-versible consequences; and (f) impacts of climate change. \n14. In addition to applying resource efficiency and \npollution control measures as required in this ESS, when the project has the potential to consti-tute a significant source of emissions in an already degraded area, the Bor rower will consid er addi-\ntional strategies and adopt measures that avoid or minimize negative effects. These strategies include, but are not limited to, evaluation of project location alternatives.\nA.  Management of air pollution10\n15. In addition to the resource efficiency measures described above, the Borrow er will consid er alter-\nnatives and implement technically and financially feasible and cost-effective\n11 options12 to avoid or \nminimize project-related air emissions during the design, construction and operation of the project.\n16. As part of the environmental and social assess-\nment of the project, the Bor rower will characterize \nand estimate sources of air pollution related to the \n8 Such as air, surface and groundwater and soils.\n9 Assimilative capacity refers to the capacity of the environment \nfor absorbing an incremental load of pollutants while remaining below a threshold of unacceptable risk to human health and the environment.\n10 \u2018Air pollution\u2019 refers to the release of air pollutants (often \nassociated with the combustion of fossil fuels), such as nitrogen oxides (NO\nx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), particu-\nlate matter (PM), as well as other contaminants including GHGs.\n11 Cost-effectiveness is determined according to the capital and \noperational cost and financial benefits of the options considered over the life of the project. \n12 The options for reducing or preventing air pollution may \ninclude a combination of approaches such as: enhancing energy efficiency, process modification, selection of fuels or other mate-rials with less polluting emissions, and application of emissions control techniques. Options for reducing GHG emissions may include alternative project locations; adoption of renewable or low carbon energy sources; alternatives to refrigerants with high global warming potential; more sustainable agricultural, forestry and livestock management practices; the reduction of fugitive emissions and gas flaring; carbon sequestration and storage; sustainable transport alternatives; and proper waste manage-ment practices.project.13 This will include an estimate of gross GHG \nemissions resulting from the project, providing that such estimation is technically and financially fea-sible. Where the Borrower d oes not h ave the capac-\nity to deve lop the estimate of GHG emissions, the \nBank will provide assistanc e to the Borrowe r.\n14 For \nprojects that have diverse and small sources of emissions (for e xample, community-driv en deve l-\nopment projects) or where emissions are not likely to be significant (for example, projects in education and social protection), GHG estimations will not be required. \nB.  Management of hazardous  \nand nonhazardous wastes\n17. The Bor rower will av oid the generation of haz-\nardous and nonhazardous waste.15 Where waste \ngeneration cannot be avoid ed, the Bor rower will \nminimize the generation of waste, and reuse, recy-cle and recover waste in a manner that is safe for human health and the environment. Where waste cannot be reused, recycled or recovered, the Bor-rower will treat, destroy, or dispose of it in an envi-ronmentally sound and safe manner that includes the appropriate control of emissions and residues resulting from the handling and processing of the waste material. \n18.

It involves: (a) managing pests (keeping them be low ec onomically damaging levels) r ather than seek-\ning to eradicate them; (b) integrating multiple methods (relying, to the extent possible, on nonchemical measures) to keep pest populations low; and (c) selecting and applying pesticides, when they have to be used, in a way that minimizes adverse effects on beneficial organisms, humans, and the environment.\n19 IVM is a rational decision-making process for the optimal use of \nresources for vector control. The approach seeks to improve the efficacy, cost-effectiveness, ecological soundness and sustain-ability of disease- vector control.and the intended users.20 The Bor rower will not use \nany pesticides or pesticide products or formulations unless such use is in compliance with the EHSGs.
