ESS3 recognizes that economic activity \nand urbanization often generate pollution to air, water, and land, and consume finite resources that may threaten people, eco-system services and the environment at the local, regional, and gl obal lev els. The cur-\nrent and projected atmospheric concentra-tion of greenhouse gases (GHG) threatens the welfare of current and future genera-tions. At the same time, more efficient and effective r esource  use, pollution preven-\ntion and GHG emission avoidance, and mitigation technologies and practices have become more accessible and achievable.2. This ESS sets out the requirements to address \nresource efficiency and pollution1 prevention and \nmanagement2 throughout the project life cycle \nconsistent with GIIP.\nObjectives\n\u03d8To promote the sustainable use of resources, including energy, water and raw materials.\n\u03d8To avoid or minimize adverse impacts on human health and the environment by avoiding or mini-mizing pollution from project activities.\n\u03d8To avoid or minimize project-related emissions of short and long-lived climate pollutants.\n3\n\u03d8To avoid or minimize generation of hazardous and non-hazardous waste.\n\u03d8To minimize and manage the risks and impacts associated with pesticide use.\nScope of application\n3.

Where benchmarking data are available, the Bor rower will make a comparison to establish \nthe relative level of efficiency.\nA.  Energy use\n6. The efficient use of energy is an important way \nin which the Bor rower can contribute to sustain-\nable devel opment. When the project is a potentially \nsignificant user of energy, in addition to applying the resource efficiency requirements of this ESS, the Bor rower will adopt measures specified in the \nEHSGs to optimize energy usage, to the extent tech-nically and financially feasible. \nB.  Water use\n7. When the project is a potentially significant user of water or will have potentially significant impacts on water quality, in addition to applying the resource efficiency requirements of this ESS, the Borrower will adopt measures, to the extent techni-cally and financially feasible, that avoid or minimize water usage so that the project\u2019s water use does not have significant adverse impacts on communities, other users and the environment. These measures include, but are not limited to, the use of additional technically feasible water conservation measures within the Bor rower\u2019s operations, the use of alter-\nnative water supplies, water consumption offsets to maintain total demand for water resources within the available supply, and evaluation of alternative project locations.\n8. For projects with a high water demand that have \npotentially significant adverse impacts on commu-nities, other users or the environment, the following will apply: \n\u03d8 A detailed water balance will be devel-\noped, maintained, monitored and reported periodically; \n\u03d8 Opportunities for improvement in water use effi-\nciency will be identified and implemented; \u03d8 Specific water use (measured by volume of water \nused per unit production) will be assessed; and \n\u03d8 Operations must be benchmarked to available \nindustry standards of water use efficiency. \n9. The Bor rower will assess, as part of the envi-\nronmental and social assessment, the potential cumulative impacts of water use upon communities, other users and the environment and will identify and implement appropriate mitigation measures. \nC.

Options for reducing GHG emissions may include alternative project locations; adoption of renewable or low carbon energy sources; alternatives to refrigerants with high global warming potential; more sustainable agricultural, forestry and livestock management practices; the reduction of fugitive emissions and gas flaring; carbon sequestration and storage; sustainable transport alternatives; and proper waste manage-ment practices.project.13 This will include an estimate of gross GHG \nemissions resulting from the project, providing that such estimation is technically and financially fea-sible.

It involves: (a) managing pests (keeping them be low ec onomically damaging levels) r ather than seek-\ning to eradicate them; (b) integrating multiple methods (relying, to the extent possible, on nonchemical measures) to keep pest populations low; and (c) selecting and applying pesticides, when they have to be used, in a way that minimizes adverse effects on beneficial organisms, humans, and the environment.\n19 IVM is a rational decision-making process for the optimal use of \nresources for vector control. The approach seeks to improve the efficacy, cost-effectiveness, ecological soundness and sustain-ability of disease- vector control.and the intended users.20 The Bor rower will not use \nany pesticides or pesticide products or formulations unless such use is in compliance with the EHSGs.
