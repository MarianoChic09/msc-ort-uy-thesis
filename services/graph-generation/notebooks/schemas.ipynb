ESS3 recognizes that economic activity \\nand urbanization often generate pollution to air, water, and land, and consume finite resources that may threaten people, eco-system services and the environment at the local, regional, and gl obal lev els. The cur-\\nrent and projected atmospheric concentra-tion of greenhouse gases (GHG) threatens the welfare of current and future genera-tions.

Options for reducing GHG emissions may include alternative project locations; adoption of renewable or low carbon energy sources; alternatives to refrigerants with high global warming potential; more sustainable agricultural, forestry and livestock management practices; the reduction of fugitive emissions and gas flaring; carbon sequestration and storage; sustainable transport alternatives; and proper waste manage-ment practices.project.13 This will include an estimate of gross GHG \\nemissions resulting from the project, providing that such estimation is technically and financially fea-sible.

These measures include, but are not limited to, the use of additional technically feasible water conservation measures within the Bor rower’s operations, the use of alter-\\nnative water supplies, water consumption offsets to maintain total demand for water resources within the available supply, and evaluation of alternative project locations.\\n8. For projects with a high water demand that have \\npotentially significant adverse impacts on commu-nities, other users or the environment, the following will apply: \\nϘ A detailed water balance will be devel-\\noped, maintained, monitored and reported periodically; \\nϘ Opportunities for improvement in water use effi-\\nciency will be identified and implemented; Ϙ Specific water use (measured by volume of water \\nused per unit production) will be assessed; and \\nϘ Operations must be benchmarked to available \\nindustry standards of water use efficiency. \\n9.

Options for reducing GHG emissions may include alternative project locations; adoption of renewable or low carbon energy sources; alternatives to refrigerants with high global warming potential; more sustainable agricultural, forestry and livestock management practices; the reduction of fugitive emissions and gas flaring; carbon sequestration and storage; sustainable transport alternatives; and proper waste manage-ment practices.project.13 This will include an estimate of gross GHG \\nemissions resulting from the project, providing that such estimation is technically and financially fea-sible.
