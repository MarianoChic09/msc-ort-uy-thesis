5.  The Borrower will implement technically and 
financially feasible measures for improving efficient 
consumption of energy, water and raw materials, as 
well  as  other  resources.  Such  measures  will  inte-
grate the principles of cleaner production into prod-
uct  design  and  production  processes  to  conserve  
raw  materials,  energy  and  water,  as  well  as  other  
resources. Where benchmarking data are available, 
the  Borrower  will  make  a  comparison  to  establish  
the relative level of efficiency.
