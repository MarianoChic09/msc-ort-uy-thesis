    "\n",
    "### Faithfulness\n",
    "Measures the factual consistency of the generated answer vs the fiven context. It is calculated from answer and retrieved context. The answer is scaled to (0,1) range. Higher the better. \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer is regarded as faithful if all the claims made in the answer can be inferred from the given context. To calculate this, \n",
    "1. A set of claims from the generated answers are identified. \n",
    "2. Each of these claims is cross-checked with the given context to determine if it can be inferred from the context. The faithfulness score is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Faithfulness\\:Score = \\frac{|Number\\:of\\:claims\\:in\\:the \\:generated\\: answer \\:that \\: can \\: be \\: inferred \\: from \\:given \\:context|}{Total \\:number \\: of \\:claims \\: in \\: the \\: generated \\: answer }$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "Let’s examine how faithfulness was calculated using the low faithfulness answer:\n",
    "- **Step 1:** Break the generated answer into individual statements.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Statements:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - Statement 1: “Einstein was born in Germany.”\n",
    "            \n",
    "        - Statement 2: “Einstein was born on 20th March 1879.”\n",

    "        \n",
    "    - Statement 2: No\n",

    "- **Step 3:** Use the formula depicted above to calculate faithfulness.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Faithfulness = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer Relevancy\n",
    "Assesses how pertinent a generated answer is to the given prompt. A lower score is assigned to answers that are incomplete or contain redundant information and higher scores indicate better relevancy. This is calculated using `question`, `context` and `answer` (ground truth). \n",
    "\n",
    "An answer is deemed relevant when it directly and appropriately addresses the original question. This assessment penalizes lacks of completeness or contains redundant details. To calculate the score an LLM is prompted to generate an appropriate questions for the generated answer multiple times, and the mean cosine similarity between these generated questions and the original question is measured. The idea is that if the generated answer accurately addresses the initial questions, the LLM should be able to generate questions from the answers that align with the original question. \n",
    "\n",
    "The answer relevancy is defined as a mean cosine similarity of the original `question` to a number of artificial questions, which were generated (reverse engineered) based on the answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Answer\\: Relevancy = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} cos(E_g, E_o)$$\n",
    "$$ Answer\\: Relevancy = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{E_g. E_o}{||E_{g_i}||.||E_o||}$$\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $E_{g_i}$ is the embedding of the generated question $i$.\n",
    "- $E_o$ is the embedding of the original question. \n",
    "- $N$ is the number of generated questions, which is 3 by default. \n",

    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    ">[!Hint]\n",
    "**Question**: Where is France and what is it’s capital?\n",
    "**Low relevance answer**: France is in western Europe.\n",
    "**High relevance answer**: France is in western Europe and Paris is its capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the relevance of the answer to the given question, we follow two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 1:** Reverse-engineer ‘n’ variants of the question from the generated answer using a Large Language Model (LLM). For instance, for the first answer, the LLM might generate the following possible questions:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - _Question 1:_ “In which part of Europe is France located?”\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - _Question 2:_ “What is the geographical location of France within Europe?”\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - _Question 3:_ “Can you identify the region of Europe where France is situated?”\n",
    "        \n",
    "- **Step 2:** Calculate the mean cosine similarity between the generated questions and the actual question.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying concept is that if the answer correctly addresses the question, it is highly probable that the original question can be reconstructed solely from the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context Recall\n",
    "\n",
    "It measures the extent to which the retrieved context aligns with the annotated answer, treated as the ground truth. \n",
    "\n",
    "Computed using `question`, `ground truth` and the retrieved `context`, and the values between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating better performance.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Context precision evaluates if the ground-truth relevant items present in the contexts are ranked higher or not. Ideally all relevant chunks must appear at the top ranks.  \n",
    "\n",

The design phase should include technical specifications for process emissions from the proposed milling plant.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Design Phase\n",
    "\n",
    "    Mitigation Hierarchy: Specific details about air emission mitigation measures during the design phase, such as utilising renewable energy sources or incorporating air quality considerations in infrastructure placement, are not mentioned.\n",
    "    Construction Phase:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Dust Management: The report emphasises dust control during construction, including minimising drop heights for materials, utilising water suppression techniques, and covering vehicles transporting dry materials.\n",
    "    Timing of construction: Restricting construction activities to daytime hours as defined by the DMRE is mentioned as a way to mitigate noise pollution. While this primarily targets noise reduction, it indirectly helps minimise air emissions by avoiding activities during potential temperature inversions which can trap pollutants.\n",
    "    Vehicle Maintenance: This indirectly contributes to air quality control because exhaust emissions from well-maintained vehicles should not exceed the design limits.\n",
    "    Operational Phase:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Air Quality Monitoring: Continuous air quality monitoring for dust and other pollutants is required, with a focus on areas near the project boundary and potential sensitive receptors like nearby farms.\n",
    "    Dust Suppression: The plan includes ongoing dust suppression measures, including the use of surfactants and dust suppressants during watering, especially near project boundaries. Maintaining existing vegetation and planting additional native trees is also encouraged to act as windbreaks and reduce dust.\n",
    "    Operational Practices: The plan mandates practices to minimise dust generation, such as covering trucks carrying dry materials, using chutes at material transfer points, minimising vehicle speeds on paved and unpaved roads, and maintaining haul routes with less erodible material.\n",
    "    Blasting Management: The plan outlines measures to control dust during blasting, including limiting blasting during specific wind conditions, avoiding blasting in fog or low clouds, restricting blasting to daytime hours, and considering pre-watering or palliative application on blast areas.\n",
    "    Energy Use Reduction: While specific details are limited, the plan encourages the exploration of energy reduction options, including decarbonising the electricity supply (potentially through on-site power generation through renewables) and electrifying the mining vehicle fleet.\n",
