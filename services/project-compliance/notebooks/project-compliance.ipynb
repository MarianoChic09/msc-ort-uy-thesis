      "1. **Decarbonisation of the electricity supply**: This can be achieved through the decarbonisation of the grid emission factor as new renewable energy sources come online in the national grid system or through the installation of on-site renewable energy for own use.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Electrification of the fleet**: This involves electrifying the mine vehicle fleet to reduce fuel consumption in mobile machinery, which can be further combined with renewable energy for additional mitigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Regular servicing of vehicles and machinery**: Ensuring optimal fuel efficiency through regular maintenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Implementation of a Traffic Management Plan (TMP)**: This includes strict controls over driver training and qualifications, vehicle maintenance, vehicle certifications, speed restrictions, appropriate road safety signage, and vehicle loading and maintenance measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Minimizing vehicular movement**: Reducing the need to drive at night and during peak traffic times, and staggering vehicular activities as much as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "These measures aim to reduce the overall emissions and environmental impact of the project. \\\\\n",
      "11. What measures are in place to avoid the generation of hazardous and nonhazardous waste? & Measures to avoid the generation of hazardous and nonhazardous waste include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Implementing clean and dirty water management systems to prevent contaminated runoff from entering the natural environment.\n",
      "2. Ensuring all dirty water containment facilities remain outside of 'no-go' areas.\n",
      "3. Prohibiting the dumping of waste within 'no-go' areas.\n",
      "4. Proper storage and handling of hazardous substances.\n",
      "5. Using drip trays at fuel dispensing areas and during refueling.\n",
      "6. Storing potentially hazardous materials in appropriate containment structures.\n",
      "7. Designating specific areas for washing and cleaning construction and mining equipment.\n",
      "8. Using drip trays beneath standing machinery if left for extended periods.\n",
      "9. Prohibiting refueling or servicing vehicles within 'no-go' areas.\n",
      "10. Immediate cleanup of spillages of fuels, oils, and other harmful chemicals, with proper disposal of contaminants.\n",
      "11. Removing all general waste, construction-related plant, equipment, surplus rock, and other foreign materials from the site.\n",
      "12. Collecting and disposing of solid waste appropriately, using scavenger-proof rubbish bins and waste disposal facilities on-site. \\\\\n",
      "20. Are the methods, timing, and frequency of pesticide application designed to minimize damage to natural enemies? & The provided information does not specify details about the methods, timing, or frequency of pesticide application. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if these aspects are designed to minimize damage to natural enemies. \\\\\n",
      "19. What steps are being taken to reduce or eliminate the use of toxic or hazardous raw materials? & Steps being taken to reduce or eliminate the use of toxic or hazardous raw materials include the proper storage and handling of hazardous substances, the use of drip trays at fuel dispensing areas, storing potentially hazardous materials in appropriate containment structures, and ensuring that washing and cleaning of equipment are done in designated areas. Additionally, spillages of fuels, oils, and other potentially harmful chemicals are to be cleaned up immediately, and contaminated soil must be removed and rehabilitated appropriately. \\\\\n",
